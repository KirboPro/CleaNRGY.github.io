                <h3>Water Use</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>On average a typical person in the United States uses around 80-100 gallons of water per day on various task around the house such as bathing or showering, flushing toilets, washing dishes and doing laundry. To fix this we can fix any leaks, use water-efficient fixtures, take shorter showers or baths, wait for full loads before doing laundry, and collect and use rain water to water plants</p>

                <h3>CO2 Emissions</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the average annual CO2 emmissions per person in the United States is around 16 metic tons. This includes emissions from various sources such as transportation, electricity generation, heating, and industrial activities. To fix this we can use energy-efficient appliances and solar panels, opt for fuel-efficient or electric vehicles, conserve water and minimize waste, and practice green landscaping which is making a functional outdoor space that supports biodiversity, and conserves natural resources</p>

                <h3>Electricity Use</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>According to the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average residential electricity consumption per capita in the United States was around 10,399 kWh (Kilowatt-hours) per year. To fix this we can use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights/appliances when not in use, seal air leaks, unplug electronics, and consider solar power. You can also use LED lightbulbs. By using LEDs instead of the regular incandescent lightbulbs, 15% of an average home's electricity use, and the average household saves about $225 in energy costs per year by using LED lighting.

                <hr>
                <p>You may not think so but eating certain foods can actually be damaging to the environment. Non-eco-friendly food choices, such as heavily processed or animal-based foods, contribute to environmental issues like greenhouse gas emissions and habitat destruction. What makes it non-eco-friendly are factors like production methods and transportation. Choosing more plant-based, locally sourced, and sustainable options can reduce environmental impact and help us become more eco-friendly at home.</p>

            <div class="feature-text">
                <p>Generally, building or retrofitting a home with eco-friendly features such as energy-efficient appliances, insulation, windows, and heating/cooling systems would cost around 5%-20% more than the average home. However, the long-term savings on energy bills and potential incentives or rebates for eco-friendly features can offset some of these upfront costs.</p>

                    But the exact cost can vary widely depending on specific design choices and regional factors. It's important to consider the long-term benefits of an eco-friendly home, including reduced energy costs, improved indoor air quality, and a smaller environmental footprint, when evaluating the overall cost.</p>
